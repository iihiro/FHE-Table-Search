# Prerequisites
* Ubuntu LTS 18.04.2
* gcc 6.3.0
* cmake 3.14.1
* [Microsoft/SEAL 3.2.0](https://github.com/microsoft/SEAL/)
* doxygen (to generate documentation)
* xterm (to run demo app using `demo.sh`)

# How to build
1. Build and install [Microsoft SEAL].
2. Run the following commands at the root of the repository to build the library.
    ```sh
    $ git submodule update -i
    $ mkdir build && cd build
    $ cmake ..
    $ make
    ```
3. Once the library is built, return to the root of the repository.

# Documents

## API Reference
1. Run the following command at the root of the repository to create the API reference.
    ```sh
    $ cd doc && doxygen
    ```
2. see `doc/html/index.html`

## Basic specification
1. Run the following command at the root of the repository to create the basic specification.
    ```sh
    $ cd doc/spec-ja
    $ make latexpdf # To create PDF
    $ make html # To create HTML
    ```
2. see `doc/spec-ja/build/latex/sphinx.pdf` or `doc/spec-ja/build/html/index.html`

# How to run
1. Run the following command at the root of the repository to run demo app.
    ```sh
    $ ./demo.sh
    ```

# Demo App
The demo app consists of three processes: Decryptor, ComputationServer and User. These processes communicate as shown in the following figure.

## Decryptor demo app
* Behavior
    * Decryptor receives the new key request, then returns new keys (public key, secret key, context) and keyID. (Fig: (1)(2))
    * Decryptor receives a public key request, then returns a public key and context. (Fig: (5))
    * Decryptor receives a key discardation request, then discard keys specified keyID. (Fig: (13)(14))
    * Decryptor receives intermediate results, then decrypts it, generates and returns an encrypted PIR queries. (Fig: (8)(9))
* Usage
    ```sh
    Usage: ./dec [-p port] [-c config_filename]
    ```
    * -p port : port number
    * -c config_filename : file path of configuration file (OPTINAL)
* Configuration
    * Specify the following encryption parameters in the configuration file.
        ```
	poly  = 8192   (Default: 8192)
	coeff = 192    (Default: 192)
	plain = 786433 (Default: 786433)
        ```

## ComputationServer demo app
* Behavior
    * ComputationServer receives a query from User, then begin the computation and returns the queryID. (Fig: (4))
    * ComputationServer sends a public key request to Decryptor, then receives the public key. (Fig: (5))
    * ComputationServer generates LUT matrices. (Fig: (6))
    * ComputationServer gets intermediate results from LUTin. (Fig: (7))
    * ComputationServer sends intermediate results to Decryptor, then receives PIR queries. (Fig: (8))
    * ComputationServer re-constructs queries from PIR queries and gets the results from LUTout. (Fig: (10))
    * ComputationServer receives a result request from User, then returns encryped results. (Fig: (11))
* Usage
    ```sh
    Usage: ./cs [-p port]
    ```
    * -p port : port number

## User demo app
* Behavior
    * User sends a new key request to Decryptor, then receives a secret key, public key and keyID. (Fig: (1))
    * User encrypts input values using the public key and sends a query containing the encryped input and keyID to ComputationServer. (Fig: (3)(4))
    * User sends a result request to ComputaionServer, then receives encryped results and decrypt it using secret key.  (Fig: (11)(12))
    * User sends a discardation key request to Decryptor to discard keys specified keyID. (Fig: (13))
* Usage
    ```sh
    Usage: ./user value1 [value2]
    ```
    * value1 value1
    * value2 value2 (optional)
